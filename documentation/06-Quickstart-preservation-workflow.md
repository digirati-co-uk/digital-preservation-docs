# Preservation Workflow for external applications

This document is for consumers of the Preservation API who *manage and supply their own METS file*.

Such consumers will create Deposits, Create and run import jobs, browse the repository, retrieve Archival Groups and export Archival Groups into new Deposits from which new versions can be created.

Such consumers do not use the API to manage or edit the METS file itself, run analysis tools or other operations. Such consumers are using the Preservation API for versioned object storage, rather than for generating or managing the content of those objects.
