<h1 id="uol-goobi-requirements-document---draft-v3.5">UOL Goobi
Requirements Document - DRAFT v3.5</h1>
<p>18/06/2024 Comments are tagged with the name of the responsible
person/group</p>
<h2 id="purpose-of-this-document">Purpose of this document</h2>
<p>This document is intended as a briefing to intranda from
Digitisation.IO about the workflow requirements for UOL to use Goobi as
its mechanism to manage digitisation production. This document will
detail the various workflows required, the plugins needed and
development requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on this version of the document intranda will ask questions in
order to clarify the services and developments needed and assign costs
to them. This will likely necessitate clarification meetings with
Digitisation.IO, UOL and Digirati as an iterative process.</li>
<li>The final output of this document will be a quotation (offer) from
intranda for services which will enable all of the UOL requirements to
be met.</li>
<li>This document will also form the basis for the final Digitisation.IO
report to UOL.</li>
<li>The information which has informed this document was gathered on
three separate onsite workshop days delivered by Geoff Laycock.</li>
<li>Areas where Digitisation.IO believes that Goobi developments
required will be tagged as #Development</li>
<li>There are still areas which require testing and clarification by
UOL, Digirati and intranda at the time of writing (see date above)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="headline-principles">Headline principles</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Goobi is to be used to trigger new workflows in one of 2 ways:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><ol type="a">
<li>#done From an excel import</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" type="a">
<li>By polling (requesting) digitisation tickets from the EMu requests
module API. #Development</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>#done Geoff What means polling here exactly? Is this something
repeated automatically?</li>
<li>#done Geoff-reply This means regularly requesting from the system
every 15 minutes or so to see if there are new requests. Ideally the
plugin could be configured to adjust that time so that, if it needs to
be extended to 1 hour then that could be set in the configuration.</li>
<li>#done Leeds Goobi to poll Emu every 1 hour for request module
<ul>
<li>#done Timing of polling needs to be configurable</li>
<li>#done User requests and internal staff requests go into Emu and link
to object/collection – these are then polled and pulled into Goobi to
create a new digitisation ticket/request. A flag is needed when there
are no object/item level records and therefore the selected metadata
records in Emu to attach the digitisation output/s to. Is this a new
step in the Goobi workflow? This flag would either stop the digitization
or the ingestion to Fedora/Preservation API we need confirmation from
intranda as to where this sits in the workflow. A report on what
tickets/requests are held up at this stage will enable UoL to understand
the cataloguing backlog. N.B. Some of the content to be migrated from
the Z drive will need this flag in place.</li>
<li>intranda to confirm they can poll Emu via API for digitisation
requests
<ul>
<li>#done Leeds how exactly can we poll new records if we do not know
their identifiers, how to find out about new requests? This will be
based on the last time the requests have been polled, so goobi needs to
record this date/time</li>
</ul></li>
<li>#done Excel imports are for item/object metadata.</li>
<li>#done Having a separate workflow for digitisation without
cataloguing is necessary, but not just for images to be joined with
catalogue records. The requirement may actually be two workflows:
<ul>
<li>#done A workflow to capture and store images, ready to be matched
with records/IDs when catalogued. Images would be stored in a
<code>holding area</code> until this is possible.</li>
<li>#done A workflow to capture images which will not be joined with
records/IDs or added to stores/catalogue (e.g. digitisation of
non-library content.) These images would bypass the
<code>matching</code> step and go straight to the <code>sending</code>
stage._</li>
</ul></li>
<li>#done Items cannot be transferred into Fedora without a persistent
ID, link to an item level record in Alma or Emu, and
rights/access/copyright/sensitivity information.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Each process created will have a <code>unique system ID</code> for
either ALMA or EMu this should be stored in the
<code>CatalogIDDigital</code> field in the METS file for each
process.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>#Leeds Ids to use will be confirmed (Alma/Emu or new ID service) –
Peter and Anthony to confirm
<ul>
<li>#done Examples of METS <a
href="https://dcd.intranda.com/viewer/index/">https://dcd.intranda.com/viewer/index/</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Goobi will be required to import selected metadata fields from
either ALMA or EMu automatically early in the process template.
#Development</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>#done Andrey For ALMA the request should work directly (still to be
tested by Andrey ).</li>
<li>#intranda For EMu a custom development needs to take place to do the
import and must be included in the pricing proposal then.</li>
<li>#done Geoff-reply What do you need intranda to be able to test this
and find out how much development is needed?
<ul>
<li>intranda needs detailed information for:
<ul>
<li>#done Leeds how to poll (know about new records in EMu) [request
module - AS to confirm]. Example of request module given to
Steffan/Simon</li>
<li>#done Leeds Anthony to provide API endpoint to query digitization
requests, created within a certain time frame, carrying the
“digitization pending” status</li>
<li>#done Leeds have a concordance between EMu-json and METS (Leeds to
confirm metadata to carry across.) Current metadata from EMu has been
sent to steffan/simon</li>
<li>#done Leeds Create the crosswalk that we talked about in our EMu
meeting</li>
</ul></li>
<li>#done Have intranda been able to test this, can they share the
response?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Goobi will be used to automatically or manually link master digital
media files to processes and their metadata.
<del>#Development</del></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>#Done This is out of the box functionality. No further features are
needed.</li>
<li>#done Geoff-reply Great news.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Goobi will, in certain process templates, be used to automatically
crop image files using Layout Wizzard</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>#intranda include this in pricing proposal then</li>
<li>#done Geoff-reply Yes, please include Layout Wizzard</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Goobi will be used to enhance the metadata of each process in a
variety of ways including pagination, structure, OCR to ALTO files, ICR
using Transkribus to ALTO files.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>#intranda include this in pricing proposal (using the numbers from
the amount named in <code>Fixed Price Services</code>)</li>
<li>#done Geoff-reply Thank you.</li>
<li>#done Leeds Pagination, structure are crucial for the digitisation
workflows, OCR and ICR should be optional.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>From the launch of the system, the new approach at UOL will be that
even if a user requests digitisation of a small percentage of an item
(such as a book) then the team will digitise all of the item.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>#done Leeds to review approach at 6 month intervals to understand
impact and develop internal decision tree [future action]</li>
</ul>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>At the end of processes where a user has requested an item to be
digitised Goobi will need to deliver to them their images by offering a
download link (similar to WeTransfer) but only of the specific
pages/files requested. This may also require the generation of surrogate
files for delivery. The system will need to remind the requesting person
to download their files and it must also record when the files have been
downloaded to enable the closing of the process. #Development</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>#done Geoff does this software for the download link and the
reminder exist already or shall this be part of the pricing
proposal?</li>
<li>#done Geoff-reply No, the software does not exist. I was hoping that
something similar in the open source environment could be adapted for
this. In any case the download software will need to be developed.</li>
<li>#done Leeds Surrogate files will be generated by the IIIF services
for all open content in Phase 1 of DLIP and closed content in Phase 2.
In the interim WeTransfer will continue to be used. Development by
Intranda is not needed for this.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>#done Leeds Access rights/sensitivity/licence and copyright
information must be in place for an item/object and stored in the METS
before it can be ingested into the digital preservation repository, at
item/object level these will be pulled across from Emu and can be
overwritten at a file level.
<ul>
<li>#Leeds Meeting to be arranged (Jodie and Geoff) to discuss workflow
needs for recording access rights/licencing/sensitivity and copyright
needs during digitization process to ensure this information is in the
METS files and content is not made available to users
inadvertently.</li>
<li>will happen on Fr., June 7th</li>
</ul></li>
<li>At the end of all processes the master files and the metadata will
be delivered to the S3 environment for ingestion into the digital
preservation repository. #Development</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>#done Geoff this delivery to S3 is a separate action that should
take place before the actual ingest? If so then the copying of files and
the ingest will be two separate workflow steps.</li>
<li>#done Geoff-reply From the meeting we had with Digirati my (limited)
understanding was that you deliver to S3 first, get an S3 location
reference and then trigger the ingest by passing a message to the
Digirati API to trigger the ingest to happen. UOL is this assumption
correct?
<ul>
<li>#done Leeds Yes, it is.</li>
<li>This process is described in <a
href="https://github.com/uol-dlip/docs/blob/rfc-001-what-store-in-fedora/rfcs/003-preservation-api.md">https://github.com/uol-dlip/docs/blob/rfc-001-what-store-in-fedora/rfcs/003-preservation-api.md</a>
and in the sequence diagram <a
href="https://github.com/uol-dlip/docs/blob/main/sequence-diagrams/goobi_api_interaction.md">https://github.com/uol-dlip/docs/blob/main/sequence-diagrams/goobi_api_interaction.md</a>.</li>
<li>Digirati will produce a <code>quickstart</code> guide for
Intranda.</li>
<li>UoL and Digirati are assuming that the METS Goobi will produce
carries Pronom information in the same way METS produced by Goobi at
Wellcome does - see <a
href="https://github.com/uol-dlip/docs/blob/rfc-001-what-store-in-fedora/rfcs/003-preservation-api.md#mets-obligations">https://github.com/uol-dlip/docs/blob/rfc-001-what-store-in-fedora/rfcs/003-preservation-api.md#mets-obligations</a></li>
<li>The ingest is asynchronous. When submitting an ingest job you get an
immediate response, an <code>ImportJobResult</code> (see <a
href="https://github.com/uol-dlip/docs/blob/rfc-001-what-store-in-fedora/rfcs/003-preservation-api.md#importjobresult">https://github.com/uol-dlip/docs/blob/rfc-001-what-store-in-fedora/rfcs/003-preservation-api.md#importjobresult</a>
). You can poll this to see how it’s getting along (the status field).
<ul>
<li>#done Leeds please make the links accessible for us to be able to
read them</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>After successful ingestion has been verified, and after a waiting
period, the master files will be deleted from Goobi and only low
resolution thumbnails will be kept for reference. #Development</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>#intranda take the installation and configuration of multiple
additional plugins into account in the pricing proposal.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li>If, after completion, a process needs to be edited then Goobi will
pull the original master files from the digital preservation repository
so that changes can be made (additions to files, deletion of files etc.)
before reexporting the changed files to the digital preservation
repository. #Development</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>#done Geoff The workflows need to be <code>extended</code> if an
existing process has to be adapted again, so that new (repeated)
workflow steps will be added?</li>
<li>#done Geoff-reply Yes, my understanding from your comments below is
that it is better to include correction steps as deactivated steps in
all workflows that can then be reactivated to enable the process to be
worked on again. This is preferable to moving to a new process template.
On this basis <code>extending</code> the process templates would work
better.</li>
<li>#done Geoff we would extend the workflow only if it is needed for
corrections. this is easier understandable for users then</li>
<li>#intranda after having the final API for the ingest this needs to be
taken into account for the pricing proposal</li>
<li>#done Leeds Files will not need to be retrieved if a metadata only
update is needed

<h2 id="fixed-price-goobi-services-requirements">Fixed Price Goobi
Services Requirements</h2>
<p>This section details the headline requirements for Goobi as they
relate to fixed price services which intranda offers such as
installation, maintenance, OCR, ICR, Layout Wizzard, support,
configuration, consultancy, and training.</p>
<h3 id="installation-requirements">Installation requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Install Goobi workflow to a UOL provided S3 server as a
<code>TEST Environment</code></li>
<li><del>Install Goobi workflow to a UOL provided S3 server as a
<code>PRE-PRODUCTION Environment</code></del></li>
<li>Install Goobi workflow to a UOL provided S3 server as a
<code>PRODUCTION/LIVE Environment</code></li>
<li>#done Leeds Only 2 environments are required test and
production.</li>
<li>Provide a mechanism for the UOL team to migrate settings and changes
from one environment to the next in the order
<del><code>TEST &gt; PRE-PRODUCTION &gt; PRODUCTION/LIVE</code></del>
<code>TEST &gt; PRODUCTION/LIVE</code> #Development
<ul>
<li>#done Geoff in the past such data migration between different stages
was never done automatically. Test systems tend to become outdated
usually. How shall such a data migration between these stages look like
exactly (metadata, binary data, configuration files, database content,
users etc.)</li>
<li>#done Geoff-reply My understanding of this is that the migration
should relate to the software itself and its settings only. there will
be test data (metadata and binaries in processes) in the test and pre
production systems that are used to test the various configuration
settings only. these would not need to be migrated over. Test would be
used for admins to try out different configurations and new plugin
developments by intranda. Once testing is complete in test then the
settings would be migrated to the pre production server for User
acceptance testing. After that, they would migrate to the production
server. So, in summary: Goobi version, plugins and the configuration
files would be migrating over. NOT the binaries, the processes, or the
users. intranda does that make sense? UOL does this tally with your view
on the functionality of the three environments?</li>
<li>#done Leeds We would use Puppet to do this.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Enable single sign on to each environment using Active Directory
#Development
<ul>
<li>#done Geoff is it really a regular Active Directory to
integrate?</li>
<li>#done Geoff-reply I am not exactly sure about this. I know that
there is a SSO mechanism and I remember that it was discussed in one of
the early meetings with the UOL team. I am also confident that it is
Microsoft based. UOL Please can you confirm how this will work in
reality?</li>
<li>#Leeds UoL use Azure Active Directory, Brian to advise on</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h3>
<ul>
<li>Monitor and Maintain each server environment</li>
<li>Update the Goobi operating system <code>at least annually</code> to
the latest version in the order
<del><code>TEST &gt; PRE-PRODUCTION &gt; PRODUCTION/LIVE</code></del>
<code>TEST &gt; PRODUCTION/LIVE</code>
<ul>
<li>#intranda take fixed update plan into the pricing proposals</li>
<li>#done Leeds At times agreed with UoL, with ideally at least four
weeks notice, excepting critical security updates which should be
scheduled as soon as possible.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ocr---icr---layout-wizzard-costs">OCR - ICR - Layout Wizzard
Costs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Annual OCR licence costs</li>
<li>Annual ICR Transkribus licence costs</li>
<li>Annual Layout Wizzard licence costs</li>
<li>Per 10,000 image OCR costs</li>
<li>Per 10,000 image ICR costs</li>
<li>#intranda take these costs into the pricing proposals</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="support">Support</h3>
<ul>
<li>Year 1 - 100 support hours</li>
<li>Year 2 and subsequent years - 50 support hours</li>
<li>#intranda take these costs into the pricing proposals</li>
<li>#done intranda Please include hourly rates and how these hours are
accessed.
<ul>
<li>#done Leeds intranda provides access to a support tracker where
Leeds can post support requests and used support hours are tracked</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="configuration-consultancy-services">Configuration &amp;
Consultancy Services</h3>
<ul>
<li>A pool of hours to configure the workflows as described in this
document (to be agreed after consultation between intranda, UOL and
Digitisation.IO)
<ul>
<li>#done Geoff the amount of expected work seems a little difficult to
calculate as it is a lot. We suggest to start with smaller
<code>phases</code> or <code>milestones</code> instead of
<code>EVERYTHING FROM START ON</code></li>
<li>#done Geoff-reply My understanding is that UOL would like a single
fixed price for the project work. It is, of course, OK for the
configuration work to be costed in phases (maybe one phase per process
template/workflow) but the costs we submit must be for everything
needed. intranda is that OK? UOL Is my assumption about this
correct?</li>
<li>#done intranda Are these hours included in the 100/50 hours above.
<ul>
<li>#Leeds no, configuration and setup are separate tasks from
support</li>
</ul></li>
<li>#done Leeds Yes, we would like one quote with all costs in including
optionals being broken down and clear dependencies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A fixed number of consultancy days for Digitisation.IO team members
to provide hands on support and configuration training to UOL team
members.
<ul>
<li>#done Geoff to take this into account for his pricing proposal</li>
<li>#done Geoff-reply Of course, I will add that into the proposal</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="training">Training</h3>
<ul>
<li>General Goobi training for a team of between 5 and 12 UOL staff
(Online)</li>
<li>Configuration training for a team of up to 5 UOL staff (Online)</li>
<li>Administration training for a team of up to 5 UOL staff
(Online)</li>
<li>#intranda take these costs into the pricing proposals</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="workflows">Workflows</h1>
<p>There are currently X main workflows
<code>(Process templates)</code>. These workflows will be configured as
process templates that will be installed and tested with UOL as part of
the Goobi services from intranda and Digitisation.IO. Each process
template may have variants with the addition of steps such as OCR, ICR,
Cropping, etc. these additional steps will be detailed with the tag
#Variant</p>
<h2 id="e-prints_ingest_workflow">E-Prints_ingest_workflow</h2>
<p>This workflow will be invoked in batches shortly after the
commissioning of the system. There are already many digitised records in
the E-Prints system at UOL which need to be migrated to the digital
preservation repository (the repository). In advance of this workflow
being triggered in Goobi the master digitised files and corresponding
METS XML files for each item will be stored by UOL in an S3 Bucket.
Goobi will need to be triggered to ingest these images and METS files
into Goobi as processes. in the process template the system will need to
pull in metadata from EMu or ALMA, link the imported media to the
metadata in the METS file and then export it all to the repository at
the end.</p>
<ul>
<li>Leeds Leeds will undertake the migration from EPrints, however they
need access to the documentation on how the import plugin/process works
and what format is needed for the folder/file structure. Then skip to
step 2.

<li><del>done Geoff-reply My logic for this is that if the template is
extended to allow an open step to start a corrections process then the
processes will have one open step at the point where it should be seen
as completed. This will mean that it will still display in the processes
page as all the steps will not be <code>green</code> or
<code>completed</code>. If we move them to a new project and limit user
access to that project then the processes can all sit in there with an
open step and the users will not be distracted in the other projects. If
there is a better/easier way however then we should go for that of
course.</del></li>

could be done over and over again for multiple changes in the
future.</li>
<li>#done Geoff-reply I Agree that this would make more sense as then
the original workflow information can stay with the process at all

<h2
id="digitisation_requests_workflow">Digitisation_Requests_Workflow</h2>
<ul>
<li>This workflow is for item level requests for digitisation that are
delivered by the studio team using a variety of equipment depending on
the materials requested for digitisation. This is the most complex
workflow as it involves pulling the digitisation request information
from EMu and also a newly developed mechanism to deliver a selected
amount of digitised content to the requesting user.</li>
<li>Note: A user may request (and pay for) selected content from an
item, for example 10 pages from a 100 page book. In that case the studio
team will digitise all of the book and the entirety of the book will be
delivered to the digital repository. However only the pages paid for by
the client will be delivered to them directly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pre-requisite-conditions-2">Pre-requisite conditions:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>A request tracker ticket with the status
<code>Pending digitisation</code> will be exist in EMu with a request
identifier.</p></li>
<li><p>In the request there will be a list of EMu IRNs (Minimum 1 but
there could be multiple) of items to be digitised and other information
such as page numbers requested etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The physical item will have been retrieved and will be on a shelf
for the studio team to collect or, if it is large then the location of
the item will have been communicated to the studio team.</p></li>
<li><p>Goobi functionality will be developed to enable sub projects to
be created. In this way there will be a master project called
<code>Digitisation Requests</code> with sub projects for each EMu
digitisation request ticket. Under each ticket there will be 1 or
multiple processes running independently. #Development</p>
<ul>
<li>#done Geoff why not use the Batch functionality of Goobi to group
items together?</li>
<li>#done Geoff-reply Happy with that as long as it makes it easier for
a user to see all the aspects that they are working on. I like the idea
of each sub-project being all the processes for a request as it makes it
easier to track completion.</li>
<li>#done Geoff a <code>sub project</code> means process here,
right?</li>
<li>#done Geoff-reply No. The project is
<code>Digitisation Requests</code>. The <code>sub project</code> is a
request (ID: 12345 from the EMu requests module which you have ingested
into Goobi) Under the <code>sub project</code> there are
<code>processes</code> from 1 to unlimited that are part of the request.
the request (<code>sub project</code>) is not complete until all of the
<code>processes</code> are complete.</li>
<li>#done intranda show how this can be done with batches</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Goobi functionality will be developed to enable the assignment of
a responsible user for each sub project. This will take the form of a
Workflow plugin <code>Assign Digitisation Request Responsibility</code>
where sub projects will be held until a manager has assigned
responsibility for the sub project to one person. (possible development
of the projects list page) #Development</p>
<ul>
<li>#done Geoff if we use the user assignment plugin for steps and work
with Batches then we would have that functionality already</li>
<li>#done Geoff-reply Fine with me. I wasn’t even aware that there was a
<code>user assignment plugin</code>.</li>
<li>#intranda include in pricing proposal: extend <a
href="https://github.com/intranda/goobi-plugin-step-user-assignment">user
assignment plugin</a> to cover whole batches</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Goobi reporting to be extended to enable status tracking of the
sub projects so that a report of current status is viewable and
exportable. #Development</p>
<ul>
<li>#done Geoff the Batch functionality gets visualised a charts on the
dashboard. Not exportable, but easy visible. The alternative would be a
specific statistics plugin</li>
<li>#done Geoff-reply OK, that is fine then if we go for the batches
approach. Please read my earlier answer to see if batches would still
work to achieve what I believe UOL needs here.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Goobi Dashboard to be developed to allow for pie chart or graphic
progress views on the dashboard for all live master projects
#Development</p>
<ul>
<li>#done Geoff what is a master project? Doesn’t this fit to what I
suggested here with Batches?</li>
<li>#done Geoff-reply As before, I am not sure that the batches would
work here (see above) I ==DO== think though that there needs to be pie
charts of project progress developed to go onto the dashboard for easy
visibility.</li>
<li>#intranda ask for clarification about this</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Goobi QA plugin to be set to only allow QA to be carried out by a
different user than carried out the digitisation step. #Development</p>
<ul>
<li>#intranda take this into account for the pricing proposal if not
done already</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Goobi Development to set at a project level the percentage of
processes that will be required to go through Quality Assurance. So, for
example, at the beginning of a large project the QA percentage could be
set at <code>100%</code> as default causing all processes to have the
Quality assurance step activated. Later this could be changed, say, to
<code>50%</code> and this will trigger Goobi to randomly activate QA on
50% of processes. The percentage should be able to change at any point
and then Goobi will refresh all processes where QA has not happened yet
to the percentage level. #Development</p>
<ul>
<li>#done Geoff what is the percentage expressing? Number of images?
Number of processes? Number of errors in Scans? How is this calculated
or proven?</li>
<li>#done Geoff-reply The percentage would be number of processes. the
system would not need to calculate the number of errors and therefore
<code>when</code> the percentage set for the project should be lowered.
that would be a decision from the team based on what they have found.
The key thing is that when their percentage is changed to, say
<code>10%</code>, only <code>1 in every 10</code> processes would go to
the QA step. That percentage needs to be set at a project level in the
configuration and then, after setting the correct number of processes
are sent for QA only.</li>
<li>#intranda take this into account (QA on a percentage of processes in
a project, defined on a project level)</li>

<ul>
<li><del>#done Geoff What kind of system is it? Does it need to be

<li>Goobi will poll the EMu request tracker API at fixed intervals (TBC
every 30 minutes during working hours and days) to pull back NEW
requests with the status <code>Pending digitisation</code>. Each New
request will be imported into Goobi with the following steps:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The request ticket will be imported as a sub project under the
master project <code>Digitisation requests</code> #Development
<ul>
<li>#done Geoff please see my comments above</li>
<li>#done Geoff-reply replied above</li>
<li>#done Leeds every 60 mins</li>
<li>#Leeds make sure that the requests to EMu allow us to get a list all
orders younger than a specific date. Email of EMu requests sent to
Simon/Steffan</li>
<li>#intranda test if the communication works as written in the mail
from Anthony</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The metadata from the requests will be imported as project
properties (e.g.: specifications, information, email address of
requesting person, Request tracker ticket number etc.) #Development
<ul>
<li>#done Geoff please see my comments above, as we need real data for
testing</li>
<li>#done Leeds please can you provide access to the requests module
data via the API to intranda</li>
<li>#intranda check the samples that Leeds provided: Any request with
the markers <code>Digitisation</code> / <code>Download Request</code>
which are also marked <code>Completed</code> are standard examples. See
<code>RRREQ-2024-171</code> and <code>RRREQ-2024-116</code> as two
recent examples.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The project properties will be viewable in the task page of each sub
process in a properties box (possibly through the copying of the sub
project properties to the process properties) possible need for a new
properties area in the task page #Development
<ul>
<li>#done Geoff what do you expect here as new functionality
needed?</li>
<li>#done Geoff-reply Basically the properties that have been imported
from the EMu module will have the <code>Brief</code> for the project in
there, things like amounts paid, quantities, deadlines, email address of
the requesting person etc. It would be helpful to have these showing as
information in all the processes for a single request so that the users
have it as reference. My suggestion would be to allow multiple
properties boxes on the task page so you had a read only area with all
this information and then an editable properties area if we need it to
gather information from the users like check boxes etc.</li>
<li>#done intranda present a similar development tomorrow</li>
<li>#intranda plan an extension of the batch functionality to allow
properties per batch that get shown inside of the tasks as well</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Each item in the request will be created as a process under the sub
project with the EMu IRN as the Process title. #Development
<ul>
<li>#intranda the import mechanism needs to take this batch-assignement
into account</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Goobi will automatically assign a deadline (set centrally at, for
example, 1 month) to the sub project #Development
<ul>
<li>#done Geoff this would work with Batches already. However: What to
do if a deadline is exceeded?</li>
<li>#done Geoff-reply good news. I guess the batch should be flagged in
some way (maybe on the dashboard) if it has exceeded the deadline?</li>
<li>#intranda include in quote (for batch)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A manager will assign a user to the sub project in the new workflow
plugin <code>Assign Digitisation Request Responsibility</code> as a
property. #Development
<ul>
<li>#done Geoff this means: per task, right?</li>
<li>#done Geoff-reply no to all the processes in the sub project.</li>
<li>#intranda plan the extension of the user-assignment-plugin to be
usable for entire batches and to allow assignment of groups and users
(not users only)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Goobi will assign the user assigned to the digitisation tasks
(i.e. Item collection, assessment, scanning steps etc.) in the process
template of each of the processes in the sub project (so that they only
appear in the task list of that specific person). #Development
<ul>
<li>#done Geoff This does need more clarification</li>
<li>#done Geoff-reply What I mean here is that when the user is assigned
to the processes in a sub project (a digitisation request with multiple
item level processes in it) then the user needs to be assigned only to
the manual steps. In other words not to the automatic ones. This means
that the tasks for the manual steps (scanning etc.) will only appear in
the task list of the assigned user and not everyone else in the user
group.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>All the processes will be open at the step assessment in Goobi.
<ul>
<li>#done Geoff we need concrete samples to understand how the users
request would look like and which data we get exactly there</li>
<li>#done Geoff-reply agreed, I have requested that data from UOL
above.</li>

single processes</li>

<code>Digitisation clarification needed: ITEM ID:</code> and the EMu IRN
of the process in the subject line, the comments text in the email body

<li>#done Geoff what needs to be developed here exactly? You are talking
about the mass upload plugin here, right? Not the mass import
plugin.</li>
<li>#done Geoff-reply Apologies it should have read Mass upload The
issue is that currently in the settings barcodes are either allowed or
not. If they are set to allowed then filename mass uploads do not work
because the system is looking for barcodes. If they are not set to
allowed then mass uploads with barcodes would not be linked to processes
because the filenames would not match. The plugin needs to be developed
to allow both depending on the project in the configuration. So: Project
A (external digitisation by a company where they are required to do the
file naming properly before sending the data back to UOL) is happening
at the same time as project B where the internal team are doing mass
digitisation using barcodes.</li>

id="large_scale_digitisation_workflow_outsourced">Large_Scale_Digitisation_Workflow_Outsourced</h2>
<p>This workflow is for large scale digitisation projects where the work
will be carried out by third party providers. It is envisaged that this
will likely be for image based digitisation in the medium term but a
#Variant could be created for moving image or audio projects in the
future, based on this process template.</p>
<h3 id="pre-requisite-conditions-4">Pre-requisite conditions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>All items to be digitised are catalogued to item level on EMu or
ALMA.</li>
<li>Each item is entered in the mass import interface to be important
via EMu IRN or the ALMA BIBNET reference.
<ul>
<li>Dockets are printed out then and put into the books</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A project has been set up in Goobi with a total number of processes,
estimated number of pages, a start date, and a deadline for
completion.</li>
<li>The supplier has received the materials with the barcodes and a
detailed specification.</li>
<li>The supplier scans always the barcode-docket page before each book.
Naming of the files is not important anymore then</li>
<li>The images are uploaded into a given S3-bucket into subfolders</li>
<li>The mass upload plugin reads from the S3-bucket (ignores the naming
of files and folders), checks the barcodes and puzzles the images to the
correct Goobi processes

comments, questions and clarifications.</li>
<li>Based on that feedback #intranda will ask further questions in order
to clarify the services and developments needed and assign costs to
