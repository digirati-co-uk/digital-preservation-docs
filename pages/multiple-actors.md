# Multiple actors

Multiple staff picking up processes

External donors being involved

How do we lock?
What do we lock?

Leave notes - file open
Move stuff around - structure locked

Do file notes imply DB? 
Do they live in METS
Do we throw them away afterwards?

Leave notes for people
Checkboxes per file / folder for workflow collab

-	I can share a job with a donor / other staff member, even opening up just that one job. Anyone can leave notes on any file or folder. There are a fixed set of flags that can be set by various parties, these appear as checkboxes

Multiple staff members can pick up the same process

-	Implies a set of processes in motion… pigeonholes again?
-	Do they need to be locked? Or are they stateful so doesn’t matter who triggers a move?

-	As a potential depositor (donor), not a staff member, I can be given a login to a system that is focused only on me providing my files with no distractions. I can upload, I can take my time, I can come back the next day, I can remove things I’ve uploaded by mistake, I can see the folder and file layout, I can add notes to folders and files. At the start of this process there is a form to fill in that establishes consent / agreements etc. This lives with the deposit throughout its journey. This is not Archivematica for real.

-	When I’m ready I can submit the object. After that I can’t edit – I can’t delete files for example – but I can participate in a process with an archivist or digital preservation person; we can look at it together.

-	As a () I can create a sharing link that allows access to a particular file, or a folder of files, or a whole digital object. The sharing link has time limits and will expire after the period I specify. I can use this to send files to customers who have made a digitsation request, too – even if it’s a digitised workflow from Goobi
