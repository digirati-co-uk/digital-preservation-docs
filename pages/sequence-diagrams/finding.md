# Finding deposits and preserved objects

Even Goobi

If I go to the Preservation UI I can find a job OR a long-since preserved object by ANY of its IDs – EMu, Accession, Job, Fedora URI, Catalogue API, even web page URL. Q – is the id minter doing this for us?
There is a distinction between already-preserved content and working content, but I can search across both (I might not know where a thing is). Care must be taken with the repository layout for findability. There will be things in preservation that ARE NOT catalogued – so how do we keep track, how do we not let them be forgotten?
