# Preservation UI

What's driving the view navigation within a Digital Object in the repository? Its Container and Binary structure, as in the prototype Storage API dashboard? Or the structMap in the METS file?

Neither of these on their own are adequate. Sometimes they might agree completely. Sometimes there might be no METS file at all. Sometimes there might be but it doesn't reference all the files, or references them wrongly.

So in some way, both sources have to contribute to the view.
