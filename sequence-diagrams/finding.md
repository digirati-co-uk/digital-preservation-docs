# Finding deposits and preserved objects

Even Goobi objects - they are in Fedora too.

If I go to the Preservation UI I can find a job OR a long-since preserved object by ANY of its IDs – EMu, Accession, Job, Fedora URI, Catalogue API, even web page URL. 

Q – is the id minter doing this for us?

A - yes, I think so.

There is a distinction between already-preserved content and working content, but I can search across both (I might not know where a thing is). Care must be taken with the repository layout for findability. There will be things in preservation that ARE NOT catalogued – so how do we keep track, how do we not let them be forgotten? Examples (from user stories) include "peripheral/supplementary files about the record (e.g. handlists, donated collection guides and lists, donor and provenance information)". These things are preserved, but in another digital object, that may not have a catalogue record.
