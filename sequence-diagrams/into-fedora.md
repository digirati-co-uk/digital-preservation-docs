# Content into Fedora

- There is a preservation_target property of a deposit which can be applied at any time. And may have been automatically assigned and might not be editable for some users. It's the Fedora path this deposit will end up at.

- After the preservation step, ALL working files are hard-deleted from the working space. This includes uploaded things that we decided not to push to preservation.

- I want to specify a publication date at which time a job is pushed to Fedora

- I can control WHEN synchronisation with asset delivery happens. For Goobi, the mechanism will be same as Wellcome, put a msg on a queue; for Preservation UI – as soon as preserved; or on a schedule (on this date?)
