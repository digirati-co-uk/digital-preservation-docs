# Multiple actors

Multiple staff picking up processes

External donors being involved

How do we lock?
What do we lock?

Leave notes - file open
Move stuff around - structure locked

Do file notes imply DB? 
Do they live in METS
Do we throw them away afterwards?

Leave notes for people
Checkboxes per file / folder for workflow collab

- -	I can share a job with a donor / other staff member, even opening up just that one job. Anyone can leave notes on any file or folder. There are a fixed set of flags that can be set by various parties, these appear as checkboxes

Multiple staff members can pick up the same process
-	Implies a set of processes in motion… pigeonholes again?
-	Do they need to be locked? Or are they stateful so doesn’t matter who triggers a move?
